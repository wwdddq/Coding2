# Python Challenge

As a beginner, I encountered many challenges and problems in completing my Python Challenge assignment. In this reflection readme, I would like to share some of the things I learned as well as some of the problems I encountered and solutions I came across in the process.
Firstly, I would like to say that this challenge was really fun! Each level made me feel excited and curious, and I learned a lot of new Python knowledge and skills. I found this challenge not only an opportunity to practice programming in Python, but also a great way to develop logical thinking and problem solving skills.

However, I encountered some difficulties during this challenge. The biggest problem was that the requirements of the questions in some of the levels were a bit vague and required me to explore and try on my own. In this case, I found a good solution by looking at other people's solutions. Sometimes other people's thoughts and code can help me understand the problem and the solution, as well as give me some insight and ideas.

Another difficulty is that I am not familiar with some Python libraries and modules. In such cases, I go to the official documentation or online tutorials. In the process, I learned a lot of useful information, such as Python's regular expression module re and the image processing library PIL. i found that looking at the documentation was a very important skill to help me understand Python better and learn how to use new libraries and modules.

Finally, I would like to say that this challenge does take some time and patience. Sometimes I would encounter difficulties and errors that required me to try and find solutions over and over again. However, I feel that the process was worth it because it gave me a better understanding of Python and the nature of programming. I believe that through this challenge, I will be better equipped to deal with future programming challenges and problems.

All in all, this Python Challenge was a great opportunity to practice and learn. Although it has some difficulties and challenges, I believe that through continuous learning and exploration, I can better understand the nature of Python and programming.
